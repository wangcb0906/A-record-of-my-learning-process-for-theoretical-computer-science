# A-record-of-my-learning-process-for-theoretical-computer-science

I took the MOOC <a href="https://www.chinesemooc.org/web/course_detail.php?courseid=4420">introduction to theoretical computer science</a>, instructed by associate professor Tian Liu at Peking University, finished all the homework and passed the final test in September 2024 to support further study of a graduate program related to computer science in Germany. Unfortunately, the platform is in a wrong state and can not certify my study. I have written to the instructor and he advised me to contact the operating team, but I got no response from them.  
So I put my hand-wirting notes of the lerning process for theoretical computer science on <a href="https://github.com/wangcb0906/A-record-of-my-learning-process-for-theoretical-computer-science">Github</a>.  
The reference books are:

* Logic in Computer Science, Second Edition. M. Huth, M. Ryan, Cambridge, 2004
* Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Third Edition. Michael  Sipser. Cengage Learning, 2013
